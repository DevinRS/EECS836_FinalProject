# 🧠 Deep Learning for IMU Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project investigates the use of deep learning models to classify human activity using time-series data from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The classification task includes:

- **No Activity**
- **Walking**
- **Bending**

We use both lab-collected and public IMU datasets to train and evaluate models, with a long-term goal of deploying on edge devices.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- ✅ Train deep learning models for IMU-based activity classification.
- 📊 Compare model performance across different architectures (accuracy, F1-score).
- 📈 Present visualizations of evaluation results.
- ⏳ *Optional*: Compare global vs personalized models using transfer learning.
- 📦 *Optional*: Apply model compression techniques for edge deployment feasibility.

---

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes
- End-to-end pipeline for activity classification from IMU data.
- Performance benchmarks across model architectures.
- Insights into personalization and edge optimization.
- Final report and demo showcasing our results.
